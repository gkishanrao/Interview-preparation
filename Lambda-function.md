#   1. What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying resources.

âœ…  2. What triggers a Lambda function?
Lambda can be triggered by:
      
      â€¢ S3 (e.g., file upload)
      
      â€¢ API Gateway (for web APIs)
      
      â€¢ CloudWatch Events or EventBridge
      
      â€¢ DynamoDB Streams
      
      â€¢ SNS/SQS
      
      â€¢ Step Functions


 âœ… 3. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous invocation?
      Synchronous: Caller waits for result (e.g., API Gateway).
      
      Asynchronous: Lambda queues and processes later (e.g., S3, SNS).

 âœ… 4. Can you invoke a Lambda function manually?
   There are many ways we can invoke a lambda function manually:
   
         â€¢ AWS Console
         
         â€¢ AWS CLI
         
         â€¢ SDKs
         
         â€¢ Test events


  âœ… 5. What are the benefits of using AWS Lambda?
  
	â€¢	No server management
 
	â€¢	Scales automatically
 
	â€¢	Pay only for usage (per ms)
 
	â€¢	Event-driven execution
 
	â€¢	Easy integration with other AWS services
 
  âœ…6.	 How does Lambda pricing work?
 
	â€¢	Requests: First 1M requests/month are free
 
	â€¢	Duration: Based on execution time in GB-seconds
 
               Example: 128MB function that runs for 1 second = 0.000000208 USD

  âœ…7. What languages does Lambda support?
  
	        # Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET (C#), and custom runtimes using Docker
         
	 âœ…8	What is the maximum execution timeout for a Lambda function?
  
	         â€¢	15 minutes (900 seconds)
          
 âœ…9.	What is the memory range supported by Lambda?
 
	â€¢	128 MB to 10,240 MB (10 GB)
 
 âœ…10.	How do you trigger a Lambda function?
 
	â€¢	Through services like API Gateway, S3, CloudWatch Events, DynamoDB Streams, SNS, SQS, and more.
 
 âœ…11.	What is a cold start in Lambda?
 
              Itâ€™s the initial startup time when Lambda creates a new container to run your function. This may cause latency.
              
 âœ…12.	What is a warm start?
 
                 A warm start happens when AWS reuses an already initialized container, resulting in faster execution.
                 
 âœ…13.	How can you reduce cold starts?
 
            	â€¢	Use Provisioned Concurrency
            	â€¢	Keep dependencies minimal
            	â€¢	Optimize initialization code

ðŸ”¹ Advanced/Technical (11â€“25)
	11.	How do environment variables work in Lambda?
You can configure key-value pairs that are accessible through the runtime (e.g., System.getenv("MY_ENV") in Java).
	12.	What is the role of the Lambda handler function?
Itâ€™s the entry point that AWS invokes to start executing your logic.
Example in Python:
[8:55 am, 9/7/2025] Kishan: def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return "Hello World"



    13.	How do you monitor Lambda functions?
	â€¢	Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Metrics, and Alarms
	â€¢	View invocation counts, errors, duration, etc.
	14.	What is concurrency in Lambda?
	â€¢	Refers to the number of executions running at the same time
	â€¢	Default quota: 1,000 concurrent executions per account
	15.	What is Provisioned Concurrency?
It pre-warms a set number of instances, ensuring consistent performance by avoiding cold starts.
	16.	Can Lambda functions access a VPC?
Yes. You can configure a Lambda function to connect to private resources in a VPC, such as RDS or EC2.
	17.	Whatâ€™s the difference between synchronous and asynchronous invocation?
	â€¢	Synchronous: Caller waits for response (e.g., API Gateway)
	â€¢	Asynchronous: Caller doesnâ€™t wait (e.g., S3 events, SNS)
	18.	What is the Lambda execution role?
An IAM role that grants your function permissions to access AWS resources (e.g., S3 read/write, CloudWatch logging)
	19.	What happens when a Lambda function fails?
	â€¢	Synchronous: Error returned to caller
	â€¢	Asynchronous: Retries automatically
	â€¢	Use DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) or Lambda Destinations to capture failed events
	20.	Can you version a Lambda function?
Yes. Lambda supports versioning and aliases for deployment strategies like blue/green deployment.
	21.	How do you deploy a Lambda function?
	â€¢	Via AWS Console, CLI, SDK
	â€¢	Use AWS SAM, Serverless Framework, Terraform, etc.
	22.	How can Lambda functions be packaged?
	â€¢	As a .zip file with code and dependencies
	â€¢	As a container image (up to 10GB) for custom runtimes
	23.	What is Lambda@Edge?
Run Lambda functions closer to users using CloudFront, for low-latency processing at the edge.
	24.	What is the maximum Lambda payload size?
	â€¢	Request/response (synchronous): 6 MB
	â€¢	Event payload (async): 256 KB
	â€¢	With API Gateway: 10 MB
	25.	How do you test Lambda functions locally?
Use tools like AWS SAM CLI (sam local invoke) or Docker-based emulators.
